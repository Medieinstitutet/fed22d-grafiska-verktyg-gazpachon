About the design
 
Our design is a landing page for the mobile phone called Nothing phone.

We wanted to make a modern and clean looking webpage, but we also wanted it to stand out,

not to be like every other website on the internet.

The strong contrast in colors are meant to capture the consumers attention, while keeping it clean and easy on the eye. The buttons are important to "scream" at you to give that contrast.

The fonts are meant to give a techy clean feel. The point is to hold up to the today's view of normal tech sites, but with our twist on it to keep it fresh.

Design elements, such as layout, imagery, and white space, should be used to create hierarchy and guide the user's eye to the most important information and calls to action on the page.

Overall, the goal of the design choices on a landing page is to create a visually appealing and intuitive experience for the user that effectively communicates the value of the product or service being offered.
